This is Project which I am working on is part of my study. Basically we have some labs and we have to finish this project as a part of Lab Assignments. 
So just stay with me untill I really cook something!

I have posted something which was part of my first lab so not 100% accurate. Just prompts are working. I think I am making entire thing till end of samester. Just wait and watch!

Thanks.
